# Marimekko-Chart-Generator
This is a R shiny apps written to generate a Marimekko Chart. It is based on https://learnr.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/ggplot2_marimekko_mosaic_chart/ the but I have changed the codes so that it is compatible to the latest version of R packages.

The sample input file is given with dummy data provided.
The header of the input file can be changed but the same changes need to be made in the R code as well to ensure that the code works.

In addition, the data will be pivoted automatically within the code, hence there is no need to summarize the data beforehand.
